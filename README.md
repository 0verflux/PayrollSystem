# Payroll System

A Windows Application that tracks the employeesâ€™ pay with their employee information on how much they have work for the past few days and will translate it to the total pay, this may include the hourly rate, and how many regular hours and overtime hours has the employee worked, and adjustments made.

## About the Project
You may notice that the project here is constructed with an *Anemic Model*. I'm still learning on how I could apply the Domain Driven Design in certain projects (yes, because it's the only way I can test how this design can be applied, which kinda affects my subjects). So far, this is my second working project that I'm able to accomplish (the first one is a Hotel Management System, which is also an *Anemic Model*.

This project wouldn't be accomplished without the aid of **Angelo Raymundo**, who provided the concepts.
